Dev Log
-------

### 2018-08-19 Sunday

Initial brainstorm. Perhaps something about walking around in the real world, finding ghosts, high-fiving them, and then sharing what you named them with other players via QR codes? And it all works offline.

### 2018-08-23 Thursday

Brainstormed more ideas. Perhaps fixed grid, fixed set of cells / experiences that modulos depending on lat/long? More story-focused than sharing focused.
